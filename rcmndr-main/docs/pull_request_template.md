## Definition of Done

Closes #[your ticket number]

For every submission to the codebase, check the following:

- [ ] Code fulfils the user story and scenarios set out in the github task and UI prototype.
- [ ] The feature has been thoroughly manually tested. (Ask other devs to give some fresh eyes on this as you go.)
- [ ] All tests run and passed from terminal. Any broken tests fixed, not disabled or skipped.
  > `npm test`
- [ ] Tests added or updated where appropriate. (Be pragmatic about adding new tests, think; how critical is this module or function? If this function broke due to changes, how would it affect the user experience?)
- [ ] eslint run and passes. Any issues fixed.
  > `npm run lint`
- [ ] Code is well formatted
  > `npm run format`
- [ ] Typescript compiles code with no type errors
  > `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] PR created in Github.

You will get a peer review from one of the teachers.
After all the peer review comments are addressed, the branch is merged to main!

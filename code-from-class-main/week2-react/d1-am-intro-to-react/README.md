```js
// App.jsx

import React from 'react'
import Welcome from './Welcome'

function App() {
	return <Welcome message="Hello World"/>
}
```

```js
// Welcome.jsx
import React from 'react'

export default function Welcome() {
	// const message = props.message
  const welcomes = ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"]

	return (
    {welcomes.map(welcome => { return <p>{welcome}</p>)}}
    // expected output: 

    // "Hello"
    // "Hi"
    //"Hey"
  )
}
```

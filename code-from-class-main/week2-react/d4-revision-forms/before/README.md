# React Forms

## Steps to build the App

## Short version

The `App` component will render both `Form` and `List` components so that we can hoist the `state` and share it with child components

1. A tour around the project
1. Add a form
1. Console the form and view it in the dev tools
1. Read the form contents
1. Update the state when the form is submitted

## Longer version

In this version we're going to build the app but with `react-router-dom` to implement client-side routing

1. Setup the `routes` and add a `Layout` component with `<Outlet />`
1. Move the state to the `App` component so it can be prop drilled
1. Programmatically navigate when the form is submitted
